    "## My CSSE Journey and Final Project: *The End RPG Game*\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout CSSE1 and CSSE2, especially from Trimester 2 to 3, I built a strong foundation in coding by learning core programming skills like JavaScript, control structures, object-oriented programming, and software engineering practices. I worked closely with my team to plan, design, and develop a 2D RPG game called **The End**, which serves as our final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The End** is more than just a game—it’s a showcase of everything we’ve learned. We implemented features like finite state machines for game flow, player inventory systems, interactive NPCs, and dynamic environments using object classes. I contributed by debugging complex issues, helping write modular code, and collaborating on gameplay logic and visual design. This project highlights how we applied coding fundamentals in a creative and socially engaging way through game development.\n",
