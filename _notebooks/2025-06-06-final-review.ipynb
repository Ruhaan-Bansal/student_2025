    "## My CSSE Journey and Final Project: *The End RPG Game*\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout CSSE1 and CSSE2, especially from Trimester 2 to 3, I built a strong foundation in coding by learning core programming skills like JavaScript, control structures, object-oriented programming, and software engineering practices. I worked closely with my team to plan, design, and develop a 2D RPG game called **The End**, which serves as our final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The End** is more than just a game—it’s a showcase of everything we’ve learned. We implemented features like finite state machines for game flow, player inventory systems, interactive NPCs, and dynamic environments using object classes. I contributed by debugging complex issues, helping write modular code, and collaborating on gameplay logic and visual design. This project highlights how we applied coding fundamentals in a creative and socially engaging way through game development.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Software Engineering Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning Changes**: Organizing and scheduling updates or features before writing code.\n",
    "- **Checklists**: Ensuring necessary steps or requirements are followed during development.\n",
    "- **Burndowns**: Visual charts tracking the amount of work left versus time remaining.\n",
    "- **Coding with Comments**: Writing explanations inside code to make it more understandable.\n",
    "- **Building Help Documentation**: Creating manuals or guides to explain how to use or understand the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Development Lifecycle Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source Control**: Managing and tracking code changes using tools like Git.\n",
    "- **Forking**: Creating a personal copy of a repository to make changes independently.\n",
    "- **Branching**: Creating parallel versions of code to develop features or fix bugs safely.\n",
    "- **Building**: Compiling and preparing the program for execution.\n",
    "- **Testing and Verification**: Checking that the software works as expected through various test methods.\n",
    "- **Pull Requests**: Requesting to merge changes from one branch into another after review.\n",
    "- **Merging/Integrating**: Combining code from different branches into a unified codebase.\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Releasing the finished product to users or a live environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrospective Engineering Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentation**: Sharing what was built and how it works with an audience.\n",
    "- **Live Reviews**: Walking through the code or product in real time for feedback.\n",
    "- **Demos**: Showing a working version of the project to demonstrate progress or functionality.\n",
    "- **Code Reviews**: Team members reviewing each other’s code for quality and correctness.\n",
    "- **Revising Plans**: Updating goals and schedules based on what was learned during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numbers**: Represent values for counting or calculations (e.g., 42, 3.14).\n",
    "- **Strings**: Textual data enclosed in quotes (e.g., \"hello world\").\n",
    "- **Booleans**: Represent true or false values used in logic.\n",
    "- **Arrays**: Ordered lists of items stored in a single variable.\n",
    "- **JSON Objects**: Structured data format using key-value pairs (e.g., `{ \"name\": \"Alex\" }`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Operations**: Combine or manipulate text (e.g., concatenation).\n",
    "- **Mathematical Operations**: Perform arithmetic like addition, subtraction, etc.\n",
    "- **Boolean Expressions**: Logical statements that evaluate to true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Repeating actions using loops like `for` or `while`.\n",
    "- **Conditions**: Making decisions in code using `if`, `else`, or `switch`.\n",
    "- **Nested Conditions**: Using multiple conditionals within one another to handle complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input/Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML5 Input**: Using HTML form elements to collect data from users.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Ensuring input data is correct and acceptable before processing.\n",
    "- **Key Events**: Detecting and responding to keyboard interactions.\n",
    "- **Document Object Model (DOM)**: Programming interface for HTML and XML documents, allowing dynamic updates to content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Writing Classes**: Defining blueprints for creating similar objects.\n",
    "- **Creating Methods**: Adding functions that belong to a class.\n",
    "- **Instantiating Objects**: Creating a specific object from a class.\n",
    "- **Using Objects**: Accessing and working with class instances in code.\n",
    "- **Calling Methods**: Executing an object's functions.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Input values given to functions or methods.\n",
    "- **Return Values**: The output result produced by a function or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: Each class or function should focus on one task.\n",
    "- **Object Literal**: Creating objects directly using `{}` syntax.\n",
    "- **Object Instance**: A specific object created from a class.\n",
    "- **FSMs in Game (Finite State Machines)**: Managing different game states like menus, battles, or exploration.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Reusing code by creating new classes from existing ones.\n",
